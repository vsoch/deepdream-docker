# CHANGELOG

This is a manually generated log to track changes to the repository for each release. 
Each section should include general headers such as **Implemented enhancements** 
and **Merged pull requests**. All closed issued and bug fixes should be 
represented by the pull requests that fixed them. Critical items to know are:
versions coincide with tags on Github (and containers pushed to Docker Hub)

 - deprecated / removed functionality
 - changed defaults
 - backward incompatible changes

## [master](https://github.com/vsoch/deepdream-docker/tree/master) (master)
 - original development release for testing CI (0.0.1)
